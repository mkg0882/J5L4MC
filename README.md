J5L4MC is a launcher for Minecraft written to be compiled on Java 5. The intention is mainly to allow modern Microsoft authorization for Minecraft to be used on older computers (my specific use case is a Power Mac G5). It is currently in a preliminary state of development with some basic functionality and the way it handles the setup and launching process may be changed frequently. It's currently able to launch up to 1.6.4, but to launch above 1.5.2 on Java 5 requires a custom recompiled client.
